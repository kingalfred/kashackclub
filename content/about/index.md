# About
The King Alfred School Hack Club was founded by Ori Marash and Felix Ronneberger after noticing the lack in a dedicated club for those interested in STEM subjects in KAS. We provide the resources and knowledge needed to learn how to code, or advance your knowledge.

This website is still under construction so please let either of us know through our school emails if something is wrong.
