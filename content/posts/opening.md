> KAS HackClub's first session will be on Tuesday the 15th of October at 4:00pm-5:00pm in the Senior ICT Lab

## Some more information
When we say "hack", we're referring to the "life hack" type of hacking. Simply put, hacking is creative problem solving ‚Äì and it often includes code. HackClub teaches students to code and to use coding skills to solve problems, not to crack into your bank account (unless that's what you're in to üòÉ).

We're going to be working on different projects every week, with members learning by making, not listening to boring teachers. Also, KAS Hacks isn't alone! Hack Club is a **global** network of programming clubs so we can get support from all around the globe.

## How sessions will run
  1. A project will be set out, the first project is creating a personal website
  2. Members work on self-directed coding projects. Learn by making.
  3. At the end, everyone (who wants to) demos their projects for the rest of the club

## Final Words
Come by and see how it is! Oh, and almost forgot--THERE WILL BE FREE PIZZA üçïüçïüçï
